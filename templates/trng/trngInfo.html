                  True Random Number Generator (TRNG)
                </h2>

                <p>
                  A True Random Number Generator (TRNG), also known as a
                  Hardware Random Number Generator (HRNG) or a Non-Deterministic
                  Random Bit Generator (NRBG), is a device that generates random
                  numbers from a physical process, such as thermal noise,
                  atmospheric noise, or quantum phenomena. Unlike pseudorandom
                  number generators (PRNGs), which use deterministic algorithms,
                  TRNGs produce genuinely random numbers that are unpredictable
                  and have high entropy.
                </p>

                <h3>Principles of TRNGs</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Unpredictability: The generated numbers should be impossible
                    to predict better than by random chance.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Uniformity: The numbers should be uniformly distributed,
                    with equal probability for any number to be generated.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Independence: The generated numbers should be statistically
                    independent, unrelated to any previously generated numbers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Non-determinism: The generation process should be based on a
                    physical phenomenon that is inherently random and
                    non-deterministic.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>TRNG Components</h3>
                <p>A typical TRNG consists of the following components:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Entropy Source: A physical process that produces random
                    noise, such as thermal noise, atmospheric noise, or quantum
                    phenomena.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Digitizer: Converts the analog output of the entropy source
                    into a binary representation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Conditioning: Improves the quality of the random bits by
                    removing biases and correlations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Health Tests: Continuously monitor the TRNG's output to
                    ensure proper functioning and detect any failures or
                    attacks.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example: Generating a Random Number</h3>
                <p>
                  Suppose we have a TRNG that uses atmospheric noise as its
                  entropy source. The atmospheric noise is sampled and
                  digitized, producing a stream of random bits:
                </p>
                <p>1011010001101011...</p>
                <p>
                  After conditioning and health tests, the random bits are ready
                  for use. To generate a random number between 0 and 255, we can
                  take 8 consecutive bits from the stream:
                </p>
                <p>10110100 = 180 (in decimal)</p>
                <p>Thus, the TRNG has generated a random number: 180.</p>

                <p>
                  A True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is a device or algorithm
                  that generates a sequence of numbers that are truly random and
                  unpredictable. Unlike pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs),
                  which use algorithms to generate numbers that appear random
                  but are actually deterministic, TRNGs use physical phenomena
                  to generate truly random numbers.
                </p>

                <h4>How TRNGs Work</h4>

                <p>
                  TRNGs typically use one or more of the following methods to
                  generate random numbers:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Thermal Noise:</strong> This method uses the random
                    fluctuations in electrical current caused by heat to
                    generate random numbers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Photonic Noise:</strong> This method uses the random
                    fluctuations in light intensity to generate random numbers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Radioactive Decay:</strong> This method uses the
                    random decay of radioactive isotopes to generate random
                    numbers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Atmospheric Noise:</strong> This method uses the
                    random fluctuations in radio frequency signals in the
                    atmosphere to generate random numbers.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Advantages of TRNGs</h4>

                <p>TRNGs have several advantages over PRNGs:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Unpredictability:</strong> TRNGs generate truly
                    random numbers that are unpredictable and cannot be
                    reproduced.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>High Entropy:</strong> TRNGs generate numbers with
                    high entropy, meaning they are highly random and
                    unpredictable.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Security:</strong> TRNGs are more secure than PRNGs
                    because they are less vulnerable to attacks that rely on
                    predictability.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Applications of TRNGs</h4>

                <p>TRNGs have several applications:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cryptography:</strong> TRNGs are used to generate
                    keys for secure communication.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Simulation:</strong> TRNGs are used to simulate
                    real-world phenomena in fields such as finance and science.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Gaming:</strong> TRNGs are used to generate random
                    numbers for games that require high randomness and
                    unpredictability.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Overall, TRNGs are an important tool for generating truly
                  random numbers, and their applications are diverse and
                  widespread.
