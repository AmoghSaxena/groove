                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                  Asymmetric cryptographic primitives, also known as public-key
                  cryptography, are fundamental building blocks in modern
                  cryptosystems. They provide secure communication and
                  authentication in various applications and protocols.
                  Asymmetric primitives use a pair of mathematically related
                  keys: a public key and a private key.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Public and private keys: Asymmetric primitives use a pair of
                    keys, where the public key can be freely distributed, while
                    the private key must be kept secret.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    One-way relationship: It is computationally infeasible to
                    determine the private key from the public key, ensuring the
                    security of the cryptosystem.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Encryption and decryption: Messages encrypted with the
                    public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding
                    private key, providing confidentiality.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Digital signatures: Messages signed with the private key can
                    be verified using the public key, ensuring authentication,
                    integrity, and non-repudiation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Key exchange: Asymmetric primitives enable secure key
                    exchange over insecure channels, allowing parties to
                    establish shared secret keys for symmetric encryption.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Asymmetric Primitives</h3>
                <p>
                  There are several types of asymmetric cryptographic
                  primitives, each with its own mathematical foundations and
                  properties:
                </p>

                <h4>1. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)</h4>
                <p>
                  RSA is one of the most widely used asymmetric primitives. It
                  is based on the difficulty of factoring large composite
                  numbers. RSA provides both encryption and digital signature
                  capabilities.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</h4>
                <p>
                  ECC is based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves
                  over finite fields. It offers smaller key sizes compared to
                  RSA while providing equivalent security. ECC is used for key
                  exchange (ECDH) and digital signatures (ECDSA).
                </p>

                <h4>3. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DH)</h4>
                <p>
                  Diffie-Hellman is a protocol that allows two parties to
                  establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. It is
                  based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms. DH
                  is commonly used for key exchange in various protocols.
                </p>

                <h4>4. Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)</h4>
                <p>
                  DSA is a standard for digital signature generation and
                  verification. It is based on the difficulty of computing
                  discrete logarithms. DSA is used in various security protocols
                  and applications.
                </p>

                <h4>5. ElGamal Encryption</h4>
                <p>
                  ElGamal is an asymmetric encryption scheme based on the
                  Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It provides probabilistic
                  encryption, meaning that encrypting the same message multiple
                  times results in different ciphertexts.
                </p>

                <h4>6. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)</h4>
                <p>
                  With the advent of quantum computing, researchers are
                  developing post-quantum cryptographic primitives that are
                  resistant to attacks by quantum computers. Examples include
                  lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, and
                  multivariate cryptography.
