                <p class="mb-4">In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of <span class="text-success">3</span>, <span class="text-primary">D</span> would be replaced by <span class="text-warning">A</span>, <span class="text-primary">E</span> would become <span class="text-warning">B</span>, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

                    The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security.

                    Example:
                    <br>
                    The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of <strong>23</strong> (the shift parameter is used as the key):

                    <br><br>
                    <code>
                    Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
                    <br>
                    Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
                    </code>
                    <br><br>
                    When encrypting, a person looks up each letter of the message in the "plain" line and writes down the corresponding letter in the "cipher" line.
