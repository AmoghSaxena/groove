                  What is Symmetric primitives?
                </h2>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                  Symmetric cryptographic primitives, also known as secret-key
                  cryptography, are fundamental building blocks in modern
                  cryptosystems. They use a single secret key for both
                  encryption and decryption, providing confidentiality,
                  integrity, and authentication. Symmetric primitives are widely
                  used due to their efficiency and performance compared to
                  asymmetric primitives.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Single secret key: Symmetric primitives use a single secret
                    key that must be securely shared between the communicating
                    parties.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Encryption and decryption: The same key is used for both
                    encrypting plaintext into ciphertext and decrypting
                    ciphertext back into plaintext.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Fast and efficient: Symmetric primitives are generally
                    faster and more efficient than asymmetric primitives, making
                    them suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Confidentiality: Symmetric encryption ensures that only
                    parties with access to the secret key can decrypt and read
                    the encrypted data.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Message authentication: Symmetric primitives can be used to
                    generate message authentication codes (MACs) to ensure the
                    integrity and authenticity of data.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Symmetric Primitives</h3>
                <p>
                  Symmetric primitives can be categorized into two main types:
                  block ciphers and stream ciphers.
                </p>

                <h4>1. Block Ciphers</h4>
                <p>
                  Block ciphers operate on fixed-size blocks of data, typically
                  64 or 128 bits. They encrypt each block independently using
                  the secret key. Examples of block ciphers include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): A widely used block
                    cipher with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    DES (Data Encryption Standard): A legacy block cipher with a
                    56-bit key size, now considered insecure.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Blowfish: A fast and secure block cipher with variable key
                    sizes up to 448 bits.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Stream Ciphers</h4>
                <p>
                  Stream ciphers encrypt data one bit or byte at a time,
                  generating a pseudorandom keystream that is combined with the
                  plaintext. Examples of stream ciphers include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4): A widely used stream cipher, now
                    considered insecure due to various vulnerabilities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Salsa20: A fast and secure stream cipher with a 256-bit key
                    and a 64-bit nonce.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ChaCha20: An improved variant of Salsa20, offering better
                    security and performance.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Substitution Ciphers</h4>
                <p>
                  These are classical ciphers are older encryption techniques
                  that were used historically. While they are not secure by
                  modern standards, they serve as important educational
                  examples. Two notable classical ciphers are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Caesar Cipher: A simple substitution cipher that shifts each
                    letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions. It
                    is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Vigen√®re Cipher: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that
                    uses a keyword to encrypt the plaintext. It is an
                    improvement over the Caesar Cipher, providing better
                    security against frequency analysis attacks.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Pseudorandom sequences</h4>
                <p>
                  PRNGs are algorithms that generate sequences of numbers that
                  appear random but are actually deterministic. They are used in
                  various cryptographic applications, including key generation
                  and nonce creation. One common PRNG is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Linear Congruential Generator (LCG): A simple and fast PRNG
                    that generates a sequence of pseudorandom numbers based on a
                    linear recurrence relation.
                  </li>
                </ul>
