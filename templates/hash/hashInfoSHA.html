                <p>
                  A cryptographic hash function is a hash algorithm (a map of an arbitrary binary string to a binary string with a fixed size of ùëõ bits) that has special properties desirable for a cryptographic application:

                  <li>A hash function is a serious mathematical process that holds a critical role in public key cryptography. Why? Because it‚Äôs what helps you to:

                  A hash function is a unique identifier for any given piece of content. It‚Äôs also a process that takes plaintext data of any size and converts it into a unique ciphertext of a specific length.
                </p>
                <p>The first part of the definition tells you that no two pieces of content will have the same hash digest, and if the content changes, the hash digest changes as well. Basically, hashing is a way to ensure that any data you send reaches your recipient in the same condition that it left you, completely intact and unaltered

                  A hash function is a versatile one-way cryptographic algorithm that maps an input of any size to a unique output of a fixed length of bits. The resulting output, which is known as a hash digest, hash value, or hash code, is the resulting unique identifier we mentioned earlier.

                    Example:
                    <br>
                    For example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve logged on to public Wi-Fi to send me an email. (Don‚Äôt do that, by the way. It‚Äôs very insecure.)  So, you write out the message, sign it using your digital certificate, and send it on its way across the internet. This is what you might call prime man-in-the-middle attack territory ‚Äî meaning that someone could easily intercept your message (again, because public wireless networks are notoriously insecure) and modify it to suit their evil purposes.
                    <br>
                    <div class="col-sm-5 text-center text-sm-left">
                      <div class="card-body pb-0 px-0 px-md-4">
                        <img
                          src="{% static 'assets/img/hashex.png' %}"
                          height="300"
                        />
                      </div>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    The example above is of a digitally signed email that‚Äôs been manipulated in transit via a MitM attack. The hash digest changes completely when any of the email content gets modified after being digitally signed, signaling that it can‚Äôt be trusted.
                    <br><br>
                    So, now I receive the message and I want to know it‚Äôs legitimate. What I can do then is use the hash value your digital signature provides (along with the algorithm it tells me you used) to re-generate the hash myself to verify whether the hash value I create matches the one you sent. If it matches, great, it means that no one has messed with it. But if it doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ well, metaphoric klaxons sound, red flags go up, and I know to not trust it.
                    <br><br>
                    Even if something tiny changed in a message ‚Äî you capitalize a letter instead of using one that‚Äôs lowercase, or you swap an exclamation mark where there was a period ‚Äî it‚Äôs going to result in the generation of an entirely new hash value. But that‚Äôs the whole idea here ‚Äî no matter how big or small a change, the difference in hash values will tell you that it isn‚Äôt legitimate.
