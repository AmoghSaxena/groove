                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Key Less Primitives, also known as unkeyed primitives, are cryptographic primitives that do not require a secret key for their operation. These primitives provide various security properties and are commonly used in cryptographic protocols and applications. Key Less Primitives are essential building blocks for ensuring data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.</p>
              
                <h3>Types of Key Less Primitives</h3>
              
                <h4>1. Hash Functions</h4>
                <p>Hash functions are mathematical algorithms that take an input (message) of arbitrary size and produce a fixed-size output called a hash or digest. The main properties of cryptographic hash functions are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Pre-image resistance: Given a hash value, it should be computationally infeasible to find the original input.</li>
                  <li>Second pre-image resistance: Given an input, it should be computationally infeasible to find another input that produces the same hash value.</li>
                  <li>Collision resistance: It should be computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Examples of widely used hash functions include SHA-256, SHA-3, and MD5 (although MD5 is no longer considered secure).</p>
              
                <h4>2. Message Authentication Codes (MACs)</h4>
                <p>Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are cryptographic primitives used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of a message. A MAC is computed using a secret key and the message itself. The recipient can verify the MAC to ensure that the message has not been tampered with and that it originates from the expected sender. Common MAC algorithms include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>HMAC (Hash-based MAC): HMAC combines a cryptographic hash function with a secret key to generate a MAC.</li>
                  <li>CMAC (Cipher-based MAC): CMAC uses a block cipher algorithm, such as AES, to generate a MAC.</li>
                </ul>
              
                <h4>3. Cryptographic Nonces</h4>
                <p>Cryptographic nonces are random or pseudo-random numbers that are used only once in a cryptographic communication. Nonces are often used to prevent replay attacks and ensure the freshness of messages. They are commonly used in protocols such as challenge-response authentication and key exchange protocols.</p>
